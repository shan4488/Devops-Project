    - They can view details such as item names, descriptions, prices, and images.
    - Ordering is made easy with options to select desired items, specify quantities, and add them to the cart.
    - Users can review their selections, make modifications, and proceed to checkout to place their orders.
2) Smart Queue Management:
    - The app optimizes queue management to minimize wait times and improve efficiency.
    - It dynamically adjusts queue priorities based on factors like order complexity, kitchen load, and estimated preparation times.
    - Resources are allocated intelligently to ensure timely order processing and delivery.
3) Filtering by Type of Meal/Queue Time:
    - Users can filter menu items or queue times based on specific criteria such as meal types (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) or dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan).
    - Queue time preferences can be adjusted, allowing users to choose express queues for quicker service or longer queues for customized orders.
4) Rating Orders:
    - Users have the option to provide feedback on their orders and overall dining experience.
    - They can rate the quality of food, delivery speed, and overall satisfaction, helping restaurants and catering services maintain high standards of service.

    - Users can easily access their order history to reorder favorite items or track the status of current orders.
6) Scheduling Meals:
